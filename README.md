# ShoppingCart
Shopping cart design using HTML, CSS, JS
live preview : https://tutul-dhar.github.io/ShoppingCart/

1. Clicking on "Add to Cart" will add the product to the cart.  
2. Clicking on the cart icon will bring the cart to the main screen.  
3. While on the cart screen, clicking on the "Cart" or "Close" button will remove the cart from the main screen.  
4. Clicking on the '+' button will increase the product quantity, and clicking on the '-' button will decrease it. However, if the quantity is decreased to 0, the product will automatically be removed from the cart.  
5. Clicking on the "Remove" button will allow you to remove a product from the cart at any time.  
6. I have used local storage for storing data, so even after refreshing the page, the previous cart information will remain.
